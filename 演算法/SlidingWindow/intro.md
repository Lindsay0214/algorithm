Sliding Window
- This is a well-known algorithm
- Generally speaking, a sliding window is a sub-list that runs over an underlying collection.
  For example, if you have an array like: `[a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h]`,
  Than, a sliding window of size 3 would run over it like...
```
  [a, b, c]
     [b, c, d]
        [c, d, e] ...
```
