- Sorting is one of the most fundamental of all algorithms in Computer Science.
- Even though many modern programming languages have built-in sorting functions, it's still a good thing to know how it works.
- We are going to learn 6 different sorting algorithms in this course. It's good to know when to use which algorithm, as they excel in some certain cases.
