### What we learned
- time and space are the concerns
  - we care about how much time it takes for an algorithm to finish a task. The less time it takes, the better it is.
  - timing our code's runtime is not realistic in terms of analysis.
    - same computer gets different runtime for the same task
    - different computing power machine gives different run time for the same task


- We care about space as well, but not as much as time in this course.
